#### Serverless Framework

Open-source CLI for building serverless architectures

#### Key Framework Features:

#### Rapid serverless deployment

Turn 200 lines of code into 4.

### Provider agnostic

Centrally deploy to AWS Lambda, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform and IBM OpenWhisk.

### Extensible with plugins

Use dozens community-made plugins, or make a new one specific to your application. Framework is open source and easy to build for.

### Multi-lingual

Don’t be hamstrung by just one language: write functions in python, node.js, java, scala or C\#.

### Automatic scaling

Don’t spend time and resources provisioning unused infrastructure. Serverless architectures expand and contract on demand, cutting server costs by more than half.

### Faster iteration

Develop and deploy infinitely scalable applications within minutes. Provision and deploy a REST API or data pipeline without provisioning resources.

### Unified dev experience

Develop, test and deploy functions and the events they react to on any cloud provider. Manage your services and functions in one place--from the CLI.
